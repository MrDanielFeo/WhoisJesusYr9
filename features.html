			<h2>The Gospel Message		</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
<div class="one">
  <p>The gospel message is commonly known as the good news of Jesus Christ.  That good news is “that Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, that he was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures” - Refer 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>John 3:16 adds, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life”.  Therefore confirming that the gospel message is for everyone on this planet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Matthew 16:14-17, Jesus asked the most important question of all which really is a question all individuals must answer. Jesus was replying to the apostles about who others say He is, and asks them, “But who do you say I am?”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Peter (apostle of Jesus) fires back this answer, “You are The Christ, the Son of the living God”.  The importance of this is that Peter understands that not only is Jesus the Son of God but The Christ - The saviour of this world.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Gospel message is therefore a message of redemption or of reconciliation to God through his Son Jesus through the forgiveness of sin/disobedience to Gods word by acknowledging who Jesus is and accepting his birth, death, resurrection and the truth of Gods Word.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To understand “Who Jesus Is”, to understand “Why the crucifixion” to understand “Why we should follow Him”, you need to go back to where it all began.  The life, death and resurrection of Jesus is the culmination of an epic biblical story that demands you as a person to answer - Who is Jesus and then respond to the gospel message.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
  </div>
  <div class="one">
    <p>The Book of Genesis is an account of the start of all things. It opens with, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). With this opening verse it challenges every bodies belief system. If God here is saying he made everything then in turn we then belong to God. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>John 1:1-3 records, “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him and without Him nothing was made that was made”. Bible commentary explains that this is a link to Jesus being the Word and Jesus being therefore with God in creation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the sixth day of creation, God creates - Adam and Eve and places them in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 1-3). Two perfect people in a perfect world and charged to go forth and multiply not only in number but multiply the knowledge of God. They would walk and talk with God in the Garden. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Until what is popularly known as The Fall of Man occurred. Adam &amp; Eve disobeyed God in the Garden (Genesis 3) and on account of this they were exiled from the Garden (Genesis 3:22-24) and direct relationship with God. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was this single event of the Fall of Man which set redemptions plan in place and necessitate the good news of The Gospel. This “Fall” saw sickness, sin &amp; death enter the world but freedom from this would be through the act of one - Jesus Christ, the Son of God (Romans 5:12-14). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To believe in The Gospel message then is to believe that on account of the Fall of Man that we were separated from God and we had no means of getting back that relationship with God and eternal life but through the redemptive power of the Cross of Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Romans 3:23-26, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, who do I say that Jesus is, “My Lord and Saviour, my Lamb and my Shepherd”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The bible states in Hebrews 13:8, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever”. The thing is, Jesus is alive. He never died on that cross so His message today is as relevant as it has ever been before. The bible is our guide in life but His revelations are our future. </p>
